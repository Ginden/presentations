# LaTeX
* Built on top of TeX
# Pros
* You probably already know it (if you were in academia)
* Allow almost arbitrary design
* Exceptionally good for mathematics

# Cons
* There is a good chance that your front-end developer don't know it
* Requires intensive preprocessing - vector images are not supported
* Learning curve isn't so great
