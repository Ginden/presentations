# XSL - FO (XSL Formatting Objects)

* XML
* Traditionally used with XSLT - XSL Templates (yay, more XML)

# Pros

* XML feels like enterprise

# Cons

* Limited tooling - **Apache FOP** for free and few expensive (like 5 thousands dollars) 
commercial solutions with limited documentation
* XML
* Formatting and text setting is poor - on par with CSS1/CSS2 possibilities (and often worse)
* Almost no community
* XML
* Prehistoric - even specification development is dead for almost 3 years
* Writing XML by hand is a pain. Writing XSLT - too.
* Did I mention XML?
