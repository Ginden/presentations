# XSL - FO (XSL Formatting Objects)

* XML
* Traditionally used with XSLT - XSL Templates (yay, more XML)

# Pros

* XML feels like enterprise

# Cons

* Limited tooling - you can get **Apache FOP** for free or pay 5000 dollars for commercial tools
* Formatting and text setting is poor - on par with CSS1/CSS2 possibilities (and often worse)
* Almost no community
* Prehistoric - last specification version was released 5 years ago
* Writing XML by hand is a pain. Writing XSLT - too.
* Formatting must be done inline - styles and content aren't separated at all
  * People use templates as workaround
